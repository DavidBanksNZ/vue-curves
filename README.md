# VueJS - Fractals/Space-filling Curves

A fairly basic VueJS application (built with Webpack) which shows some animations relating to fractals and space-filling curves.

NOTE: this project is not yet complete. Needs tidy up - plus production build doesn't work properly - the animations are missing! 
This requires further investigation.

### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
